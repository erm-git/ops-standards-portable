## Common terms

- **FHS**: Filesystem Hierarchy Standard; conventions for where things live on a Linux host.
- **`$USER:$USER`**: in shells, `$USER` expands to the current username; in `chown user:group`, `"$USER:$USER"` means “set owner and group to the current user’s name”.
- **Working tree**: normal git checkout.
- **Bare repo**: git repo without a working tree (`*.git`) used as a push target.
- **Runbook**: operational “how to do X” steps.
