## Rules (summary)

These rules apply to authored markdown under `docs/`.

- Use YAML front matter with `title:` for authored docs.
- Prefer H2/H3/H4 (avoid multiple H1 headings).
- Unordered lists use `-`.
- Code fences include a language identifier when possible (e.g., `bash`, `python`).
- Prefer relative links within `docs/`.
