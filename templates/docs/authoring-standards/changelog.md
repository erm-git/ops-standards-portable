## Purpose

`CHANGELOG.md` is a curated, chronological list of notable changes.

Include changes that affect how someone uses/operates the repo:

- new or changed workflows/standards
- new scripts/automation used by normal workflows
- removals/retirements of major structures

Skip noise:

- tiny typo fixes
- pure formatting reflows

## Format

- Keep an `[Unreleased]` section at the top.
- Use change types when applicable: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
- Use ISO dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
